    "**Context**: EHR data is becoming a key source of real-world evidence (RWE) for the pharmaceutical industry and regulators to [make decisions on clinical trials](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/speeches-fda-officials/breaking-down-barriers-between-clinical-trials-and-clinical-care-incorporating-real-world-evidence). You are a data scientist for an exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing. It is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring/testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application. You have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.  \n",

The challenge is that there are many codes that map to the same or similar drug. You are provided with the ndc drug lookup file https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c1-emr-data-starter/blob/master/project/data_schema_references/ndc_lookup_table.csv derived from the National Drug Codes List site(https://ndclist.com/).

    "- With a non-technical audience in mind, explain the precision-recall tradeoff in regard to how you have optimized your model. Precision indicates the proportion of patients that the model identified as staying at least 5 days who really stayed at least 5 days. Thus, precision measures how well the model picks up on positive cases. Recall indicates, among all actual positive patients (true positive and false negative), how many did we correctly label as positively staying at least 5 days. Thus, recall measures how sensitive the model is. Ideally, we return many of the patients who stayed at least 5 days and they are mostly correctly labelled as such. A threshold of 5 days and up for time in hospital was chosen as a positive indicator for selecting the patient for the study. A threshold of 6 days yielded lower precision and recall while a threshold of 4 days yielded the same precision and recall, as well as higher AUC and F1, but the criteria is patients staying at least 5-7 days. Thus 5 days was chosen. This yielded a precision and recall of 0.75 each. \n",

Analyzing the impact of each feature on the performance of the model, and removing features that do not meaningfully contribute could create a simpler model that is easier to train. Furthermore, a deeper architecture may yield better results, especially when coupled with simpler features, or the current architecture may learn better with simpler features."
